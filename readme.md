A high-level summary of the design of the video calling application:

### High-Level Design Summary:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   - The application follows a client-server architecture where multiple clients communicate with a central server.
   - The server facilitates signaling between clients to establish peer-to-peer connections for video calling.

2. **WebRTC for Real-Time Communication**:
   - WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is used for establishing peer-to-peer communication between clients for video calling.
   - WebRTC enables real-time audio and video communication directly between web browsers without the need for plugins or additional software.

3. **Socket.IO for Signaling**:
   - Socket.IO is utilized for real-time bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
   - Socket.IO enables efficient signaling between clients to exchange session information and coordinate the establishment of WebRTC connections.

4. **Room-Based Communication**:
   - Clients are organized into rooms to facilitate group video calling.
   - Each room is identified by a unique room ID, allowing clients within the same room to communicate with each other.

5. **Client-Side Features**:
   - Clients can create or join existing rooms to participate in video calls with other users.
   - Video calling features include starting and joining calls, displaying local and remote video streams, and handling user interactions.

6. **Server-Side Features**:
   - The server manages client connections and rooms.
   - It facilitates the creation and joining of rooms, as well as the exchange of signaling messages between clients within the same room.
   - Error handling and cleanup mechanisms are implemented to handle client disconnections and empty rooms.

7. **User Interface**:
   - The user interface provides buttons for creating and joining rooms, as well as initiating video calls.
   - Video streams are displayed in designated video elements, allowing users to see themselves (local video) and other participants (remote video) during a call.



Overall, the video calling application follows a client-server architecture, leveraging WebRTC and Socket.IO for real-time communication and room-based collaboration. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating/joining rooms and initiating video calls, while ensuring scalability, robustness, and security.
